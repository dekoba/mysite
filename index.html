Jacob's Portfolio

<div class="dbox color field"> <div class="innertext">
<p>This page is serving two purposes:</p><p>
First, It will act as a launch page for future portfolio projects - 
It may even become a primary project page. The page will be updated
with information regarding new coding projects that I undertake or
have completed in the past.</p><p>Second, It is a practice project
to learn git and refine my web programming abilities. There will be
expirmental pages and other tests to find out the bounds and abilities
of both myself and these systems. </p></div><div class="innerphoto"><img class="portrait" src="images/belmore.jpg"></div></div>

Religious Thoughts
</h3>
<div class='dbox color field'><p>
It is important to have a positive meaningful worldviews.
Since most people have a religion that is deeply influential
in thier world view. The most important ethical concern is that
regarding other people. It is critically important to be concerned
with the well-being of others and thier position and problems.</p><p>

In a religious context, it is too easy to dismiss another's struggle
as 'gods will' and therefore be absolved of responsibility. It is 
important instead to take ownership of the state of the world. 
Although we do not shape the world we inherit when we first arrive
in a circumstance, we shape the world that is inherited by the next
person, and we have a responsibility to move forward in that regard
instead of allowing suffering or disconcern to propagate.</p>

An Online Course Outline
</h3>
<div class='dbox color field'><p>
Online Courses are profoundly powerful learning expiriences when handled correctly.
They need to be done as a platform of cooperative education in which communication
is specifically emphasized. Face-to-face classes benefit from tremendous amounts of
nonverbal and other communication, a gap which must be closed and further focused
to create an even greater semblence of understanding. Online learning is an equal
partnership between the educator and the learner in which each are responsible for
the results of the experience. To this end, I believe a platform for online learning
should include at least the following elements.</p>
<p>
	<ol>
		<li>A mechanism by which material can be presented, according to effective learning styles.</li>
		<li>A quick-feedback mechanism, utilizing as short of a latency as possible. Max latency of a few hours </li>
		<li>Student-driven work wherever possible. If the student does not engage in the partnership this platform fails.</li>
		<li>A expandable and sharable collection of notes and resources for learning. Nothing should be off the table.</li>
		<li>High Expectations and a means of evaluating learning. Traditional question-answer formats are likely insufficient.</li>	
	</ol>
</p><p>
I further believe this is possibly an improvement over traditional face-to-face pedagogies. I am conducting an expiriment in
which Ill work with a small group of students in a face-to-face setting to determine thier readiness for this style of learning.
If it goes well, I wil expand it into one of my future classes. Furthermore, I am thinking of creating a platform by which I can
standardize the supporting efforts of this. The big things I am expecting to put into place:</p><p>
	<ol>
		<li>An overview of the materials from beginning to end. A textbook may work for this but im thinking more of a summary.</li>
		<li>A list of assessable goals for the course: at the end, this is how students are evaluated. </li>
		<li>I varied list of example assessments. These can be quizzes, essays, teching encounters, programs, artwork, discussions, etc.</li>
		<li>A expandable and sharable collection of notes and resources for learning. This will begin slightly populated, and expanded
		as students add to it. Students will be expected to add to it.</li>
		<li>A model indicating a suggested pathway or pathways through the course. Thinking like skill-trees in video games.</li>	
	</ol>
